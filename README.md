## Why

Some people will ask me: _"Why you did that?"_

Well, a friend asked me _"What PHP can do?"_. I thought about that awhile and
the idea came up. With PHP7's performance improvement now it's possible to
emulate some systems :smile: and, come on, that's funny! :dancers:

It's based on the [GameBoy JS Emulator](https://github.com/taisel/GameBoy-Online).

## Requirements

The following PHP versions are supported:

+ PHP 5.6
+ PHP 7
+ HHVM

You will need a good terminal! I've tested only on MacOSX and Linux. I'm sorry
about that Windows guys :disappointed:

## Running

Before: Put your ROMs files (.gb or .gbc) on "roms/" folder.

```bash
$ composer install -o
$ bin/php-gameboy drmario.gb
$ bin/php-gameboy pokemon.gbc
```

## Controls

```bash
_n_________________
|_|_______________|_|
|  ,-------------.  |
| |  .---------.  | |
| |  |         |  | |
| |  |         |  | |
| |  |         |  | |
| |  |         |  | |
| |  `---------'  | |
| `---------------' |
|   _               |
| _|W|_         ,-. |
||A   D|   ,-. "._,"|
|  |S|    "._," Dot |
|    _  _ Comma     |
|   // //           |
|  // //    \\\\\\  |
|  N  M      \\\\\\ ,
|________...______,"
```

+ Left = A
+ Up = W
+ Down = S
+ Right = D
+ A = Comma (,)
+ B = Dot (.)
+ Select = N
+ Start = M

## TO-DO

Converting from the JS paradigm was a lot of work, and I still need to adapt somethings like:

- [x] Code standard - PSRs, please!
- [ ] Array of functions - Maybe in PHP it's not the best approach
- [ ] Pixel auxiliary array - Very CPU intersive to convert RGBA every time
- [ ] Classes - Core is too big!
- [ ] Profiling and otimizing - XHProf to find the most intensive functions
- [ ] Save/Restore - I need to save my Pokémon, please!
